There are a lot of posts up on XDA with the Pixel feature port for compatible Android devices. But it gets convenient when everything's under one hood. Also not all are technically sound and well versed with flashing ZIPs, wiping the caches and so on. We need it simple! The common language that we all understand is that of apps.

I've come up with an app that puts everything together and makes it convenient for everyone to get all the features of Google Pixel XL with just a button click.

PREREQUISITES:
1. Any Android device running 7.1.x
2. Root Access with SuperSu installed
3. TWRP installed

NOTES:
1. This app doesn't have a roll-back-to-stock feature, though I'm working on it. In the meanwhile if you want to roll back, simply flash the stock 7.1.1. OTA ZIP which you can fetch from here.
2. There are a few features missed out in the package from Pixel though I'm working on porting them too. Read below to know more.
3. The in-app download as of now is about 100 MB so make sure you have enough data / internet before proceeding.

BUGS:
1. A weird one in Google Camera app that the HDR icon randomly disappears. (P.S. same camera version from stock) It requires a workaround which will be updated soon. Though, it isn't a bug with the camera. Just that the HDR icon inside the camera app doesn't show up!
2. In case your wallpaper app crashes, just follow,
i. Open any File Manager (preferably get Root Explorer from Play Store)_
ii. Grant it SuperSu access
iii. Head over to /system/app/Wallpapers-wallpaper/
iv. Just tap the Wallpapers-wallpaper.apk and install it
v. Now try setting a wallpaper to set it.


WHAT'S THERE:
1. Pixel Navigation Bar icons + animation
2. Pixel Live Data Wallpapers + Pixel Live Earth Wallpapers
3. Pixel Launcher
4. Blue Theme
5. Google Assistant
6. Pixel Round Icons
7. Fingerprint Notification Gestures
8. Cherry Picks Store that makes it convenient to select custom MODs and install them!

WHAT'S NOT THERE:
A full roll-back to stock.
